I suppose someone might wonder why on earth I'm using OpenSSL when I have
written my own crypto library (Botan; http://botan.randombit.net), which is
obviously much better than OpenSSL. ^_^

First, OpenSSL is more likely to be found on the average system. For similar
reasons, I wrote it in C instead of C++, even though C++ would have been quite
a bit easier. Actually, I've since rewritten the whole thing in (really ugly)
C++, but that's besides the point.

Secondly, and more importantly, OpenSSL has damn near the fastest DES
implementation around (everything from well-tuned C to asm for lots of
systems). Since the cracking speed depends 95% on how fast we can run DES, this
is important. Botan's DES code is fast, but not nearly as fast as OpenSSL's;
and that's ignoring the (small but noticeable) performance hit for C++.

Anyway, there wouldn't be much benefit from using a different library, even if
it was just as fast as OpenSSL. Besides a few pieces of brain-damage in the DES
interface, we wouldn't get much benefit. There are less than 10 lines of code
that actually deal with OpenSSL in any way, the rest is generic data structures
stuff.
