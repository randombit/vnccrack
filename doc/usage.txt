$ ./vnccrack [wordlist] [crpairs]

where [wordlist] is a file containing potential passwords, and [crpairs] is a
file containing one or more challenge-response pairs, as 32 byte hex strings
separated by a space, like so:

9EB777429696A68BCF161D0DD7D30DD4 6231F933D44AB5BF1E10A7A8A63AAED6

When VNCcrack finds a password, it will tell you which C/R pair it corresponds
to, with the first line being C/R pair number 1.
