VNCcrack 2.1
2008-11-07

This is a program, licensed under the GNU GPL v2, which can scan a
pcap file (as generated by tcpdump and many other tools) for any VNC
authentication sessions and attempt to crack them against a wordlist.

It has been tested sucessfully to descrypt the authentication session
between TightVNC 1.3.9 running between a Gentoo Linux/amd64 client and
a Windows XP/x86 server.

VNCcrack requires the following libraries be installed:

  pcap - http://www.tcpdump.org/
  Botan - http://botan.randombit.net/

Many Linux and BSD distributions ship one or both of these libraries.
For instance on Debian
  $ apt-get install libbotan1.7 libpcap0.8

Usage is
$ ./vnccrack dump.pcap wordlist

where wordlist is a file containing potential passwords. This
parameter can also be the single character '-', meaning potential
passwords should be read from standard input. This is useful for
external password generators such as John the Ripper; which could be
used like so:

$ john -i -stdout:8 | ./vnccrack dump.pcap -
